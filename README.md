# TKT Internship Project - Task Management System Backend

This project was developed for my internship at **TarÄ±m Kredi Teknoloji**. 
It is a backend API application for a **Task Management System**, built with **C#** and **.NET 9**.

The project allows users to create, update, delete, and manage tasks within departments. 
JWT authentication is implemented for secure access to the API.
